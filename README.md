This is the ultimate **Macintosh Performa**. It was definitely one popular computer back in the day (the 90s), and I'm so glad that it has its chance to be remembered again. Honestly, though, how could anyone ever forget about this absolute *masterpiece*?

Here's a little comparison between the awesome **Macintosh Performa** and my dusty old Macbook Air.
