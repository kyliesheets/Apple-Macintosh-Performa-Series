This is the ultimate **Macintosh Performa**. It was definitely one popular computer back in the day (the 90s), and I'm so glad that it has its chance to be remembered again. Honestly, though, how could anyone ever forget about this absolute *masterpiece*?

Here's a little comparison between the awesome **Macintosh Performa 5200CD** and my dusty old Macbook Air.

| Spec | Macintosh Performa 5300 | Macbook Air 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Brand** | Apple | Apple |
| **Processor Type** |  PowerPC 603e  | Core i3 |
| **Speed** | 75-100MHz | 1100MHz |
| **Storage** | 790 MB - 1.0 GB | 256 GB - 2TB SSD |
| **Memory** | 8 MB - 64 MB RAM | 8 GB - 16 GB RAM |
| **GPU** | N/A | 8-core GPU |

*Reasons why I LOVE the Macintosha Performa 5300:*

* The color is absolutely breathtaking, why isn't that color available to Apple's current computers??
* It's such a brag-worthy piece of equipment. If people saw that in my house, they would say "Omg, what's that?" and I'd be like "Oh, just my Macintosha Performa 5200 from the 90s. And then they'd be like "Ooh, vintage!"
* There's not as much storage as my Macbook Air, which would force me to conserve my space on the computer and allow me to learn how to organize well, manage my storage, and so much. They're all such valuable skills to have in life!
* The graphics aren't as good, but personally, I take this as a good thing because it forces me to use my imagination to think of what my computer is trying to show me, which just allows me to become a more imaginative and creative person!
* No one else has it. These days, people are all too alike and having this computer would definitely allow you to stand out from the rest. Be different! Be unique! Be originial! Be you!
